# Trial / Sample Class Policy

Q: Do you offer a trial class?  
A: Thank you for your inquiry. I am afraid that we do not offer trial class.

Why not a “trial class”?  
- We believe a normal lesson provides a truer picture than a one‑off taster.  
- For the first lesson, fees follow the regular schedule and teachers conduct full observation to ensure the class truly fits your child, then advise next steps.
