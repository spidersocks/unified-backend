# Cantonese classes

- Our focus is on Mandarin/Chinese programs; we do not currently run a standing (regular) Cantonese course.
- If you need Cantonese options, contact us — depending on demand and teacher availability, we may arrange 1:1/small-group short-term options or refer a partner.

For details, please contact our staff:
