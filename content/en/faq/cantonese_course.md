# Cantonese classes

- We provide Cantonese lessons in 1:1 or small-group formats. Scheduling depends on demand and teacher availability.
- A short diagnostic assessment is used for placement and timetable recommendations.
- Curriculum focus: character recognition, character writing (stroke order), grammar and sentence patterns, reading comprehension, speaking and writing — delivered with game-based activities to build confidence.
