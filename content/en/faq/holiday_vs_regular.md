# Holiday vs Regular Classes

Q: What’s the difference between holiday classes and regular classes?  
A: Holiday classes are more concentrated and theme‑based with creative activities; regular classes build long‑term foundations in language (and/or literacy) with steady routines and homework feedback. Both can complement each other depending on goals and availability.
