# Mandarin/Chinese Program – Overview

- Experience and curriculum: Many years of Chinese teaching with a well-structured curriculum; students from both local and international schools.
- Teachers and credentials: Native Mandarin teachers holding the PSC (Putonghua Proficiency Test) certificate; experienced instructors.

## What’s included (varies by unit)
- Character recognition
- Character writing (correct stroke order)
- Grammar and sentence structure
- Reading comprehension practice
- Writing practice (composition)
- Pinyin study (for Mandarin learners)

- Feedback and homework: Regular progress feedback; homework is reviewed with comments so parents can track progress via worksheets and notes.
- Simplified-character option: Available upon request and suitability.
- Entry and placement: A short diagnostic assessment determines the best class/unit.
- FAQs (K1/K2 “how many characters”): We don’t promise a fixed character-count; milestones depend on each child’s foundation and pace. Targets are set after assessment and adjusted as they progress.
