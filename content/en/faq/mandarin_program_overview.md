# Mandarin/Chinese Program – Overview

- Experience and curriculum: Many years of Chinese teaching with a well‑structured curriculum; students from both local and international schools.
- Teachers and credentials: Native‑level Mandarin teachers holding the PSC (Putonghua Proficiency Test) certificate; team includes teachers from Hong Kong and Mainland China with strong classroom experience. Clear, standard pronunciation and appropriate speaking pace are emphasised.

## Age coverage and placement
- Typical age coverage: approximately 2–12 years old (PN → P6). Students are grouped by age and level.
- Placement first: We use a short diagnostic assessment before recommending the most suitable class for each child.

## Language of instruction (Mandarin vs Cantonese)
- We offer both Putonghua (Mandarin) and Cantonese classes. Families can choose the language that best suits their child.

## Lesson duration and frequency
- Typical durations: 45 minutes (PN–K1); 60 minutes (K2 and above).
- Frequency: once per week is standard (unless a different plan is suggested after assessment).

## Beginners and early literacy
- Beginners welcome: Children who do not yet recognise characters can start in our introductory pathway (listening/speaking, picture‑based recognition, pinyin for Mandarin learners).

## Pronunciation correction
- Teachers correct pronunciation in class and provide targeted practice. Short audio models or practice suggestions may be shared to help families review at home.

## Second‑language learners (CSL)
- For international/bilingual school students or children stronger in English than Chinese, we run a Chinese‑as‑a‑Second‑Language track that builds vocabulary, sentence patterns and confidence step‑by‑step.

## Online option
- We primarily teach in‑person at our Hong Kong centre. When suitable, we can arrange Zoom lessons.

## What’s included (varies by unit)
- Character recognition
- Character writing (correct stroke order)
- Grammar and sentence structure
- Reading comprehension practice
- Writing practice (composition)
- Pinyin study (for Mandarin learners)

## Feedback, homework, and progress
- Regular progress feedback; homework is reviewed with comments so parents can track learning.
- Progress cadence: Improvement speed varies by age and starting point. We set staged goals and provide periodic summaries (e.g., monthly) to track steady progress.

- Simplified‑character option: Available upon request and suitability.
- Entry and placement: A short diagnostic assessment determines the best class/unit.

FAQs
- Q: My child is five — which class should we join?  
  A: We recommend the placement assessment first; we’ll advise the most suitable class afterwards.
- Q: Will my child understand the teacher’s accent?  
  A: Teachers use clear, standard Putonghua and an age‑appropriate pace; pronunciation is corrected during lessons.
- Q: My child only speaks English — can you help?  
  A: Yes. We start with pictures, daily‑life words, songs and simple dialogues, then transition naturally into Chinese.
