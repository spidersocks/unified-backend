# Phonics — learning outcomes and hours by level

Disclaimer: learning hours are approximate and vary with attendance, progress, and continuous assessment (e.g., dictation).

- Level 1 (≈10h): Learn all 26 phonemes; refine pronunciation and letter writing; blend to read CVC words.  
- Level 2 (≈15h): Learn phoneme‑grapheme correspondences (PGC, ~30 clusters); read/spell CCVC & CVCC; add consonant digraphs; improve penmanship.  
- Level 3 (≈25h): Use PGC + digraphs + ~10 clusters to read, spell, and comprehend sentences; build fluency and sight words.  
- Level 4 (≈10h): Focus on short‑vowel digraphs; review PGC; learn ~10 more clusters for reading/spelling.  
- Level 5 (≈25h): Double‑vowel and split digraphs; review PGC; continue fluency/accuracy and sight words; apply PGC + digraphs for sentence reading/spelling.  
- Level 6 (≈15h): “y” as vowel and consonant; spelling skills; basic SVO (subject–verb–object) sentence structure.  
- Level 7 (≈25h): Silent letters, r‑controlled vowels, homophones; apply PGC + digraphs to read/spell/comprehend and write compound sentences.  
- Level 8 (≈25h): Soft/Hard c & g, affixes, unstressed vowels; continue PGC + digraphs to read/spell/comprehend and write compound sentences; some students start short stories.
