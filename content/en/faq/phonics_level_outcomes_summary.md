# Phonics Levels (L1–L8) — Compressed Overview

Assistant notes (do not send to parents):
- If the parent asks broadly about learning outcomes “across/all L1–L8”, respond with ONLY the 3–4 bullets below unless they explicitly request per-level detail (e.g. “list each level”, “hours for each”, “level 3 specifics”).
- If they later ask for a specific level, retrieve the detailed page (PhonicsLevelOutcomes) and answer that level only.

**Summary (send these only for all‑levels queries):**
- Foundations (L1–L3): Establish all phonemes, blending (CVC → CCVC/CVCC), core phoneme‑grapheme correspondences (PGC), consonant digraphs; build early fluency + sight words.  
- Vowel & Pattern Mastery (L4–L6): Short & double vowel digraphs, split digraphs, “y” as vowel/consonant, stronger spelling accuracy, and basic SVO sentence writing.  
- Advanced Patterns & Morphology (L7–L8): Silent letters, r‑controlled vowels, homophones, soft/hard c & g, affixes, unstressed vowels → compound sentences + early short story writing for some students.  
- Typical full pathway duration: ≈1.5 years (varies by practice & attendance).

If the parent asks for “each level” or “hours per level”, use the detailed outcomes page.
