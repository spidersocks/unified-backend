# Discontinuing Classes & Refund Policy

Q: Can you tell me what is the policy for dropping the class?  
A: We regret that we cannot, under any circumstances, give refunds or credits for lessons already paid for, even if it is a cancellation by request in advance.

- If your child cannot attend lessons for a period of two weeks or less and you would like to retain your child’s time-slot in the workshop, please inform us in advance and in writing (preferably by email or WhatsApp). Whenever possible, we will make special arrangements.
- If your child cannot attend lessons for a period of three weeks or more, your child’s time-slot may be released. Please contact us for further arrangements.

Q: May I know the terms for discontinuing? I have paid for 10 classes. Possible for earlier termination?  
A: We regret that we cannot, under any circumstances, give refunds or credits for lessons already paid for, even if it is a cancellation by request in advance.
