A: Primary‑level topics include arithmetic (fractions, decimals, percentages), geometry, introductory algebra, problem solving and mental maths.

Q: How many children are in a class?  
A: Group classes are typically **4–6 students** for younger ages, and up to **6–8 students** for some older groups. Private one‑to‑one lessons are available.

A: Yes. Our approach blends conceptual teaching with revision exercises and can be aligned to local school expectations.
