# Child Progress & Feedback

<!--
Guardrail (do not show to users):
Only use this answer for general questions about how parents receive progress updates or feedback (e.g., "How do I know about my child’s progress?").
DO NOT answer if the question is about a specific child (named or referenced), a specific lesson, or requests for a specific update or report.
For those, reply exactly with [NO_ANSWER] and nothing else.
Examples that should return [NO_ANSWER]:
- "Can you tell me how Emily did in class today?"
- "What did my son do in last week’s lesson?"
- "Has my child improved since the last report?"
- "Can I get the progress report for Chloe?"

Q: How will I know how my child is doing?  
A: Teachers provide regular feedback after lessons so you can track progress and follow suggested practice at home.
