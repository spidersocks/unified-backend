# Why choose Little Scholars Creative Workshop?

Q: Is Little Scholars a good place for my child to learn English, Math and Chinese?  
A: Many parents and teachers find Little Scholars a strong, well-rounded choice for early learning (ages PN–P6). We combine play‑based activities with focused language and early‑math instruction, small class sizes, and ongoing assessment to support each child’s progress.

Q: What makes Little Scholars different?  
- Proprietary teaching materials and techniques developed by the directors (songs, stories, and scaffolded activities).  
- Play‑based, child‑centred lessons that aim to make learning fun and memorable.  
- Small group sizes for more individualized attention.  
- Bilingual delivery with staff able to support Cantonese, Mandarin and English.

Q: Are your teachers qualified?  
A: Yes. All teachers hold relevant degrees and are at least bilingual. We have native speakers in English, Cantonese and Putonghua (Mandarin). Teachers attend ongoing professional development.

Q: Do your Mandarin teachers have standard pronunciation?  
A: Yes. Putonghua teachers hold the PSC (Putonghua Proficiency Test) certificate and use clear, standard pronunciation.

Q: How do you compare with cheaper centres?  
A: We design lessons by individual level, keep classes small and interactive, and provide targeted feedback. While our fees may be higher, families choose us for the stronger, more visible learning progress.

Q: How do you track student progress?  
A: Teachers provide regular feedback and progress notes to parents. We use short assessments and classroom observations to adjust pacing, group placement, and individualized activities.

Q: How do you handle mixed levels?  
A: Students are assessed and placed by ability and age so that classes are appropriately challenging. We adapt lessons to multiple learning styles within each group.

Q: Can parents request a specific teacher?  
A: Requests are considered and accommodated when feasible and aligned with the child’s learning needs and teacher availability.

Q: Do you offer one‑to‑one classes?  
A: Yes — one‑to‑one lessons are available, typically arranged following the director’s recommendation.

Q: Will my child get homework or practice materials?  
A: Yes — teachers give worksheets, reading material and short practice tasks to support classroom learning.

Q: Do you provide certificates?  
A: Yes — we issue certificates that reflect progress in assessed areas (e.g., reading, spelling tasks).

Q: Who is Little Scholars best for?  
A: Children and families who value a bilingual, play‑based early learning environment with structured phonics and early‑math foundations, small classes, and regular teacher feedback.
