# Character Count and Learning Expectations

### How many characters should my child learn?
- Character count expectations vary based on age, prior exposure, and learning pace.
- We set age-appropriate learning goals but understand that each child develops differently.
- Our curriculum provides progressive targets, but the actual pace is adjusted through diagnostic assessment and ongoing feedback.

### What are typical character recognition goals?
Based on our comprehensive curriculum:
- **K1 (3-4 years)**: Recognition of 300+ common characters (objects, animals, colors)
- **K2 (4-5 years)**: Recognition of 500+ characters; begin pinyin for Mandarin learners
- **K3 (5-6 years)**: Expand vocabulary including verbs, nouns, adjectives; complete basic pinyin
- **P1 (6-7 years)**: Master 1000+ high-frequency characters
- **P2 (7-8 years)**: Reach 1500+ character proficiency

### Are these numbers fixed targets?
- No, these are guidelines based on typical progression.
- Some children may learn faster or slower depending on their background and exposure to Chinese at home.
- We do not promise fixed character counts; rather, we focus on comprehension, proper usage, and building a strong foundation.

### How do you determine the right level for my child?
- All new students undergo a short diagnostic assessment to evaluate:
  - Current character recognition level
  - Listening comprehension
  - Speaking ability
  - Prior exposure to Chinese (at home or school)
- Based on this assessment, we recommend the most suitable class level and learning path.

### How can I track my child's progress?
- We provide regular feedback on learning status and progress.
- Homework is reviewed with detailed comments.
- Parents can track progress through our feedback reports and reviewing worksheets.
- Depending on your child's stage, they may join our "中文悅讀悅樂課程" (Chinese Reading Joy Program) with content varying by unit.

### What if my child is not meeting the expected character count?
- We adapt teaching methods to different ages and levels to achieve learning goals.
- Our experienced native-speaking teachers (all holding 国家语委普通话水平测试证书) use diverse teaching approaches.
- We focus on meaningful learning rather than rushing to meet arbitrary numbers.
