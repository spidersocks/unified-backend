# When a document suggests contacting staff — reply [NO_ANSWER] (Assistant Only)

Purpose  
We share the same WhatsApp number with admin. Echoing “Please contact our staff” causes confusion. If retrieved text urges the parent to contact staff, or they ask to speak/arrange a call/quote for private 1:1 pricing, reply ONLY with:

[NO_ANSWER]

Do not apologize. Do not add marketing or policy.

Applies to (non-exhaustive)
- Any attempt to speak with or arrange a call/meeting with a teacher/director/staff.
- Private class quotations or pricing (any subject).
- Requests to book/schedule a call or meeting.
- Placement/level/suitability judgements (unless explicitly asking for policy — then answer policy only).
- Pass/relay/notify/ask/remind a teacher or staff.

Examples
- “Can I arrange a call with the director?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “How much for a private math 1:1 lesson?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Please book a meeting with the teacher.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Quote for private English class?” → [NO_ANSWER]

Policy exception  
If (and only if) the parent explicitly asks about policy (e.g., “What is your rescheduling policy?”), answer briefly; otherwise use [NO_ANSWER].
