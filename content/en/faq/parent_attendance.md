# Parent/Class Attendance Policy

Q: Do parents or family members need to accompany a 2.5-year-old (or other children) to class?
A: With the exception of Playgroup sessions, parents are not permitted to accompany their children to classes. This policy is designed to foster independence in our students and prepare them for a learning environment where they can thrive without parental assistance in the long run.

Q: Can parents sit in or stay in the classroom?
A: Parents may only accompany their children during Playgroup sessions. For all other classes, children attend class independently.
