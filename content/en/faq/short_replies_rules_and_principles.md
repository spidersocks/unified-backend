# Short Replies — Rules & Principles

**See also:** _short_replies_examples_ for practical Q&A examples.

---

## Rule 1 — Parent action → reply “Thank you!”
If the parent performed an action for us (e.g., paid, sent/uploaded a file, submitted homework), reply only with **“Thank you!”**.

**Example:**  
- Parent: Paid / Payment sent / Invoice paid  
  Us: Thank you!

---

## Rule 2 — Pure thanks for our info/help → reply “You're welcome!”
If the parent is thanking us for our information, help, or guidance, reply with **“You're welcome!”**.

**Example:**  
- Parent: Got it, thanks!  
  Us: You're welcome!

---

## Rule 3 — No-reply closings (do NOT respond)
If the message is only a polite closing after our acknowledgment (end of interaction), **do not reply**.

**No-reply closings include (non-exhaustive):**
- English: “You’re welcome”, “You are welcome”, “YW”, “No problem”, “NP”, “My pleasure”, “No worries”, “All good”, “Sure/Sure thing”
- Traditional Chinese (zh-HK): 「唔使客氣／唔駛客氣／不客氣」
- Simplified Chinese (zh-CN): 「不客气／不用谢／没事／没问题／客气了」

**Example:**  
- Q: Here’s the form.  
  A: Thank you!  
- Q: You’re welcome  
  A: [no reply]

**Note:**  
If the message mixes a closing with new content (e.g., “You’re welcome — also, can we change to Friday?”), treat the new content normally and ignore the closing phrase.

## Mixed Messages — Which reply to use?
- **Action performed + thanks:** (they did something for us, then say thanks) → reply “Thank you!”  
  Example: “I’ve sent the file, thanks!” → Thank you!
- **Acknowledgement of our info + thanks:** (they are thanking us) → “You're welcome!”  
  Example: “Got it, thanks!” → You're welcome!
- **Terminal closing (“You’re welcome”, “不客气”, “唔使客氣”, etc.):** → [no reply]

---

## Notes for Assistant

- For one-word confirmations of action (“Paid!”, “Sent!”, “Done.”), reply “Thank you!”.
- **Never reply “You're welcome” after a parent action; use “Thank you!”.**
- **Never reply to pure terminal closings (see Rule 3); end the thread silently.**
- If the message contains subject matter (dates/times, a student name, booking/reschedule/leave, policy/fees/timetable/course details, homework questions, etc.), do NOT use these shorthands; answer from policy/docs or stay silent per routing rules.
- **IMPORTANT:** If the message is a dated leave/reschedule/cancel notification and not explicitly asking policy, reply ONLY with [NO_ANSWER].
