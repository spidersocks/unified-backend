    - “Homework uploaded, thank you!” → Thank you!
    - “Paid, thanks!” → Thank you!
    - “Done, thank you!” → Thank you!

- **Acknowledgement of our info + thanks:** (they are thanking us for our help/info) → “You're welcome!”
  - Examples:
    - “Got it, thanks!” → You're welcome!
    - “Understood, thanks!” → You're welcome!

- **Terminal closing (“You’re welcome”, “不客气”, “唔使客氣”, etc.)** → [no reply]
