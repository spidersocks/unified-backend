# Chinese Writing — Overview & FAQs

Note: This page covers Chinese writing programs (Putonghua / 中文). We maintain separate documentation for English writing programs.

Q: Do you teach Chinese writing at Little Scholars?  
A: Yes. We introduce Chinese writing practice from K2 and continue through primary levels. Younger children begin with spoken‑to‑written tasks (picture description → simple sentences). Older students receive structured training in paragraph and essay writing, different genres, and expressive techniques.

Q: How are your Chinese writing courses organised?  
A: We offer two complementary tracks:
- Integrated writing practice: regular Chinese lessons include periodic writing exercises to reinforce vocabulary, punctuation and sentence structure.  
- Dedicated Chinese writing courses: focused weekly lessons (specialised classes) arranged by age/level — e.g., Introductory, Foundation, and Extension classes.

Q: Are writing lessons weekly?  
A: Integrated writing appears regularly within the Chinese curriculum. Dedicated Chinese writing classes are scheduled once per week.

# Lower Primary (K2 – P2) — What to expect

Q: Can K3 children learn to write Chinese?  
A: Yes. From K2 we guide children through picture‑prompted writing using teacher questioning to organise ideas (Who? Where? What? Why?). K3 students learn to produce simple, complete Chinese sentences and basic sequence.

Q: What are the main learning goals for lower primary?  
- Build the “when, where, who, what” writing concept in Chinese.  
- Convert oral descriptions into short written sentences.  
- Use basic verbs, adjectives and linking words.  
- Gain confidence and interest in Chinese writing.

Q: How are lessons taught?  
A: Teachers follow a speak‑then‑write flow: observe the picture → tell the story orally → guided sentence modelling → write and revise. Lessons integrate vocabulary, sentence patterns, punctuation and short‑paragraph conventions.

Q: How is Chinese writing different from regular Chinese lessons?  
A: Regular Chinese lessons prioritise character recognition and reading comprehension; Chinese writing lessons emphasise idea organisation, expression and transforming spoken language into written text.

# Upper Primary (P3 – P6) — What to expect

Q: What does higher‑level Chinese writing teach?  
A: Students learn multiple genres — narrative, descriptive, expository, persuasive and functional writing. We train logical structure (e.g., cause → process → result → reflection) and develop descriptive and emotional language.

Q: Besides structure, what else is taught?  
A: Focused descriptive practice (people, place, action, inner thoughts), vocabulary expansion, and rhetorical devices to make Chinese writing more vivid and coherent.

Q: Is character learning included?  
A: Yes — character/word learning is embedded in writing topics (e.g., vocabulary for people, festivals, emotions), so reading and writing grow together.

Q: Will students learn different composition types?  
A: Yes — curriculum progression:
- Lower primary: picture‑based writing & practical notes  
- Mid primary: narrative & expository pieces  
- Upper primary: argumentative essays, application writing and more advanced genres

Q: Will Chinese writing prepare my child for school essay requirements?  
A: Yes. We reference common Hong Kong primary school formats when designing advanced lessons to help students meet school expectations.

# Teaching features & outcomes

Q: What is the teaching approach?  
A: We use a "speak→write + picture prompt" method:
- Talk first to develop ideas;  
- Picture prompts to spark imagination;  
- Sentence frames and modelled language to scaffold writing;  
- Teacher feedback and guided revision.

Q: Do teachers correct compositions?  
A: Yes. Every piece is reviewed and corrected. Teachers point out vocabulary, sentence structure, logical issues and provide guided rewriting so students learn how to improve.

Q: How long until improvement is seen?  
A: With systematic training, parents typically notice clearer sentence organisation, longer sentences and richer vocabulary after about 8–12 weeks. Progress depends on starting level and practice frequency.
