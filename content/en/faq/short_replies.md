## Mixed messages — which reply to use?

- Action performed + thanks (they did something for us, then say thanks) → reply with “Thank you!”
  - Examples:
    - “I’ve sent the file, thanks!” → Thank you!
    - “Homework uploaded, thank you!” → Thank you!
    - “Paid, thanks!” → Thank you!

- Acknowledgement of our info + thanks (they are thanking us for our help/info) → “You're welcome!”
  - Examples:
    - “Got it, thanks!” → You're welcome!
    - “Understood, thanks!” → You're welcome!

## Notes for Assistant

- For one-word or very short confirmations (“Paid!”, “Sent!”, “Done.”), reply only with “Thank you!”.
- If the parent did something for us and then says “thanks” (e.g., “Sent the file, thanks!”), reply with “Thank you!”, not “You're welcome.”
- Politeness-only replies like “You're welcome” are ONLY for messages that are pure thanks or an acknowledgement of our help (e.g., “Got it, thanks!”).
- If the message contains actual subject matter (e.g., a date/time, student name, booking/reschedule/cancel/leave, policy/fees/timetable/course details, homework questions, etc.), do NOT use a shorthand from this page. The reply must address that subject matter based on policy/docs; do not make arrangements.
- If the parent sends only a file or screenshot (e.g., payment proof, homework), reply with “Thank you!”.
