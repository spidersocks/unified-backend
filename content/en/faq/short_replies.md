# Brief Parent Messages & Polite Responses

This page provides examples of natural, minimal responses for very short or transactional parent messages.  
Use these as context for the bot to handle brief acknowledgments, payment confirmations, or assignment submissions.

## **Rule: Only say "You're welcome" when the parent is thanking us for information or help.  
If the parent has completed an action for us, even if they say "thanks," ALWAYS reply with "Thank you!"**

### Examples

- **Parent:** Done, thanks!  
  **Us:** Thank you!
- **Parent:** Submitted, thank you!  
  **Us:** Thank you!
- **Parent:** Paid, thanks!  
  **Us:** Thank you!
- **Parent:** Got it, thanks!  
  **Us:** You're welcome!

> **Do:**  
> - If the parent did something for us (sent file, paid, uploaded homework, etc.) and says "thanks" or "thank you" after: **Always reply with "Thank you!"**  
>   - E.g., "Submitted, thank you!" → "Thank you!"

> **Don't:**  
> - Never reply "You're welcome" when the parent performs an action for us, even if they add "thanks".

## Mixed messages — which reply to use?

- **Action performed + thanks:** (they did something for us, then say thanks) → **reply with "Thank you!"**
  - Examples:
    - “I’ve sent the file, thanks!” → Thank you!
    - “Homework uploaded, thank you!” → Thank you!
    - “Paid, thanks!” → Thank you!
    - “Done, thank you!” → Thank you!
- **Acknowledgement of our info + thanks:** (they are thanking us for our help/info) → “You're welcome!”
  - Examples:
    - “Got it, thanks!” → You're welcome!
    - “Understood, thanks!” → You're welcome!

## Notes for Assistant

- For one-word or very short confirmations (“Paid!”, “Sent!”, “Done.”), reply only with “Thank you!”.
- If the parent did something for us and then says “thanks” (e.g., “Sent the file, thanks!”), reply with “Thank you!”, not “You're welcome.”
- Politeness-only replies like “You're welcome” are ONLY for messages that are pure thanks or an acknowledgement of our help (e.g., “Got it, thanks!”).
- **Never reply "You're welcome" after a parent action, even if they said thanks. Only use "Thank you!"**
- If the message contains actual subject matter (e.g., a date/time, student name, booking/reschedule/cancel/leave, policy/fees/timetable/course details, homework questions, etc.), do NOT use a shorthand from this page. The reply must address that subject matter based on policy/docs; do not make arrangements.
- IMPORTANT: If the message is a dated leave/reschedule/cancel notification (contains date/weekday/time or student name) and is not explicitly asking about policy, reply ONLY with [NO_ANSWER]. Do not send “Thank you” and do not summarize policy.
- If the parent sends only a file or screenshot (e.g., payment proof, homework), reply with “Thank you!”.
