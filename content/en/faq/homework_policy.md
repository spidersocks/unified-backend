# Homework expectations (FAQ)

- Principle: Homework aligns with in-class content and is designed by age/level; it typically includes reading aloud and writing tasks.
- Kindergarten (PN–K3): about 30 minutes total. We recommend splitting across short sittings; complete before the next lesson.
- Primary (P1–P6): about 30–60 minutes total (adjusted for appropriate challenge). We recommend splitting; complete before the next lesson.
- Independence: Homework reinforces taught material; children should be able to complete it independently. Teachers provide regular feedback and comments.
