# Homework expectations (FAQ)

> **Note:** If the parent message appears to be only a homework submission (e.g., “Tuesday Chinese homework: [file/photo]”), the bot should not reply.

- Principle: Homework aligns with in-class content and is designed by age/level; it typically includes reading aloud and writing tasks.
- Kindergarten (PN–K3): about 30 minutes total. We recommend splitting across short sittings; complete before the next lesson.
- Primary (P1–P6): about 30–60 minutes total (adjusted for appropriate challenge). We recommend splitting; complete before the next lesson.
- Independence: Homework reinforces taught material; children should be able to complete it independently. Teachers provide regular feedback and comments.

### Why do we have reading assignments?
Reading assignments help children practise pronunciation, pacing, and intonation. Teachers can provide feedback, which helps children learn more efficiently.

If you need adjustments to homework volume or format, please contact our staff:

For detailed feedback on your child’s assignment or reading performance, this information must come directly from the class teacher to ensure accuracy and privacy.
