# Brush Up Classes (Booster/Extra Review)

Q: When and how much are the brush up classes?  
A: Brush up classes will be recommended by Directors as needed, and are billed at the regular course fee.  
Attendance at a brush up class will be deducted from the paid course credits.

Notes:
- Directors will suggest a brush up class based on your child’s progress.
- There is no separate “brush up” fee; it uses your existing paid sessions or regular fee structure.
