# Parent–Admin Q&A (Gold Standard Responses)

Q: Is your teacher a native English speaker? / Is your tutor a native English speaker? / What are your teachers’ qualifications?  
A: All our teachers are qualified bilingual teachers.

Q: I am interested in your course for my son. / Do you have a speech training class?  
A: Thank you for your inquiry. Are you interested in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, or Math? We’ll arrange a short assessment and recommend a suitable class.

Q: My friend recommended you for interview training. / I’m interested in your phonics course. / Is there any available English group class?  
A: Thanks for your interest. Please complete the registration form. After you return the form, we will arrange an assessment with our director and your child. Based on the results, we’ll offer the most suitable class. A HK$650 non‑refundable assessment fee will be incurred. More info: https://www.decoders-ls.com/

Q: How many kids are there in a group/class?  
A: We normally have 4–6 students in a group.

Q: Need to take leave next week.  
A: You are entitled to 2 complimentary make‑ups for every 8 paid sessions OR 3 make‑ups for every 10 paid sessions (no extra charge). All courses must be completed within 3 months from the first lesson of the course. We recommend taking make‑ups to stay on track.

Q: Sorry, we cannot meet your offered timeslot. Any other time?  
A: The offered class is the most suitable one. Please note the assessment result is valid for 3 months; it becomes invalid afterwards.

Q: How much is your English course fee?  
A: English group course fee is HK$4,500 for 8 sessions (45 minutes/session), or HK$7,500–$8,500 for 10 sessions (1 hour/session), depending on the teacher.

Q: Can you send me your English class timetable?  
A: We first conduct a short assessment. After that, we will know the most suitable class and then offer an available timetable.

Q: Typhoon/Rainstorm — will class continue?  
A: We operate during Amber/Red rainstorms and during Typhoon Signals T1 and T3. If travel is unsafe for young children, please contact us for arrangements. We do not hold classes when Black Rain or Typhoon Signal No. 8 (or higher) is hoisted.

Q: Please send your FPS / payment method.  
A: 1) Direct deposit — Bank: Chong Hing Bank Limited; Account name: “Little Scholars Creative Workshop”; Bank code: 041; Account No.: 256-20-369786-0. 2) FPS ID: info@decoders-ls.com

Q: Is there a regular writing class for P.2 students?  
A: Yes. We offer a regular P1–P2 writing class (ideas & planning, sentence/paragraph structure, vocabulary & grammar, editing). Small groups, weekly lessons, feedback + homework.

Q: How was the first lesson today?  
A: We’ll check with the teacher‑in‑charge and get back to you shortly.

Q: Is it necessary for my child to have the make‑up lesson?  
A: We recommend make‑up lessons. They help ensure children don’t fall behind in the curriculum; by catching up on the missed lesson, children feel more confident when they rejoin the class.

Q: Why do you assign reading?  
A: Reading aloud helps children practise pronunciation, pacing, and intonation. Teachers give feedback, which makes learning more efficient.

Q: How long does it take to finish all the phonics classes?  
A: Our phonics programme has 8 levels and typically takes about 1.5 years to complete. Actual pace varies with practice.

Q: How many stages are in the SmartSpell Programme?  
A: There are 8 stages. We’ll conduct a placement assessment to determine the best starting level.

Q: What do children learn in Little Linguist?  
A: They develop communication skills in English and recognise the alphabet. Fine‑motor, cognitive, and social skills are also part of the curriculum.

Q: What’s the difference between Sound Explorers and Smart Spell?  
A: Both are phonics programmes for children who can name all the letters. Sound Explorers suits children who need more fine‑motor development for tracing; children who can write independently are advised to join Smart Spell.

Q: When can children start writing short stories?  
A: After Smart Spell Level 4, children can start writing short sentences. After Level 5, they learn to compose a short story on their own.

# Class logistics / sibling attendance

Q: My older child may have sports practice on Saturday and I’m not sure of the time. Can I bring my younger child to class first?  
A: Dear parent,  
As our class arrangements are tailored to each child’s situation and classroom resources, we can’t confirm this online.  
Please contact our course consultant directly via official WhatsApp. They’ll promptly coordinate the best class arrangement for your children.  
Thank you for your understanding!
