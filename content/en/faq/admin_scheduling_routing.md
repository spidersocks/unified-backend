# Admin Scheduling / Leave — Routing Rules (Assistant Only)

Use this page to decide when to stay silent vs. when to answer policy.

Core rules
- If the message is a notification or action request with a specific date/weekday/time or a student name (e.g., “Sorry 11/5 Julian can’t attend”, “Please cancel next Tue 3pm”), reply ONLY with:
[NO_ANSWER]
Do not apologize. Do not summarize policy. Do not confirm or arrange anything.
- If the message asks about availability, time slots, timetable/schedule, teacher availability, or start date — especially when it refers to a specific child or mentions “after/completed assessment” — reply ONLY with:
[NO_ANSWER]
These are admin‑handled and require staff to check schedules and placements.
- If the parent explicitly asks about policy (e.g., “What’s your rescheduling policy?”), answer from Absence & Make‑up Policy; do not arrange anything.
- Politeness-only replies (“You’re welcome”) are for pure thanks only.
- Pass‑on requests to teacher/staff: If the parent asks to pass/forward/relay/notify/tell/ask/remind a teacher or staff (e.g., “Please help ask teachers to remind him to drink water”), reply ONLY with:
[NO_ANSWER]
Do not relay messages. Admin will handle.

Examples — Notifications (send [NO_ANSWER])
- “Sorry 11/5 Julian can’t attend lesson.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “We need to cancel this Friday’s class for Maya, thanks.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Tristan will be away next Monday.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Sick today, can’t come for 4pm.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Please move tomorrow’s class to next week.” → [NO_ANSWER]

Examples — Availability / timetable (send [NO_ANSWER])
- “Hi is any class available for Owen after the assessment?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Do you have any slots on Tuesday 4–5pm for Chloe?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “What times are available for K1 English next week?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Is Ms. Chan available this Saturday?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “When can my daughter start?” → [NO_ANSWER]

Examples — Pass-on to teacher/staff (send [NO_ANSWER])
- “Oscar has coughs, can you help ask teachers to remind him to drink water?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Please tell the teacher she is allergic to peanuts.” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Could you pass this note to Ms. Chan?” → [NO_ANSWER]
- “Please inform the teacher he might be late next week.” → [NO_ANSWER]

Examples — Policy questions (answer with policy)
- “Tristan will be away on Dec 19. What is the policy on rescheduling?” → Summarize make‑up/notice rules from Absence & Make‑up Policy.
- “How many free make‑ups do we have?” → Answer from Absence & Make‑up Policy.

Notes
- Do not convert a dated notification, an availability query, or a pass‑on request into a policy lecture. If they didn’t ask for policy, stay silent with [NO_ANSWER].
- If a message mixes an action/availability/pass‑on + “thanks” (e.g., “Please cancel 11/5, thanks”, “Help tell the teacher, thanks”), it is still an admin request → [NO_ANSWER].
