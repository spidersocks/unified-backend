# Mandarin vs Cantonese Programs

### Do you offer Cantonese courses?
- Currently, we specialize in **Mandarin (Putonghua)** Chinese language programs.
- Our Chinese courses focus on Mandarin pronunciation, character recognition (simplified or traditional), pinyin, and language arts.
- We do not offer dedicated Cantonese language programs at this time.

### What is the difference between Mandarin and Cantonese?
- **Mandarin (普通话/Putonghua)** is the official language of China and is widely used in education and business across mainland China, Taiwan, and Singapore.
- **Cantonese (粤语/廣東話)** is a dialect primarily spoken in Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong province.
- While both use Chinese characters, they differ significantly in pronunciation, tones, and some vocabulary.

### Why do you focus on Mandarin?
- Mandarin is the most widely spoken Chinese language globally and is the standard for academic Chinese education.
- All our Mandarin teachers are native speakers holding the 国家语委普通话水平测试证书 (National Putonghua Proficiency Test Certificate).
- We have many years of experience with well-designed Mandarin curricula suitable for students from local and international schools.

### Can students learning Mandarin understand Cantonese?
- Learning Mandarin helps with reading and writing Chinese characters, which are shared between the languages.
- However, spoken Mandarin and Cantonese are not mutually intelligible due to different pronunciations and tones.
- Students focused on Mandarin will need separate study to speak Cantonese fluently.

### What if my child needs Cantonese support?
- For Cantonese language learning needs, we recommend seeking specialized Cantonese programs.
