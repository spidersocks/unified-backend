**Target age:**  
3 years old – 6 years old (K1 – K3)  
**Class size:**  
Small group class size, 4–6 students per class

## Advantages of Game-Based Learning

Games feel more like a form of entertainment than a method of learning. Because games include rules, definitive objectives, measurable goals and competition, they deliver an interactive experience that promotes a sense of achievement for all of the participants.

Some games have been found to improve cognitive functions like memory and reasoning. Other games have the potential to train up logical thinking, mathematics concepts, creativity and even self confidence.

## Cognitive Growth

The decision making processes required to play certain games makes the brain work hard. These cognitive exercises can range from simple decisions to the formulation of complex strategies. Children and adults of all ages can benefit from the mental stimulation that game-based learning provides.

## Skills Development

Exploring different parts of games can also be a form of learning. We design games in a way that balances academic subjects such as mathematics and history, and enhances skills like following instructions, staying focused, and extending concentration span.

Games allow kids to practise and develop physical skills such as hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills. They can also work on spatial skills, observation and visual attention processing. Interactive games help kids achieve this in an integrated learning environment.

Game-based learning allows kids to develop cognitive, social and physical skills simultaneously. This learning enhances essential life skills like cooperation and teamwork. The knowledge and skills acquired through game-based learning are retained longer than information from other learning methods.
