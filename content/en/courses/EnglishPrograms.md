2) Little Sound Explorer

- Suitable for: ~32 months – 3 years, preparing for group phonics.  
- Duration: 45 minutes.

3) Smart Spell

Notes
- Progression: Children typically move from Little Linguist → Little Sound Explorer → Smart Spell → Language Arts as they develop. Placement is determined by a short diagnostic assessment.  
- Homework and practice: Short worksheets and reading materials are assigned to reinforce classroom learning.  
- Private lessons: One‑to‑one instruction is available where recommended by the director.
