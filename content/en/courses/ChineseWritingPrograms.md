# Chinese Writing Programs — Course Overview

This pathway covers Chinese writing (Putonghua / 中文) instruction from K2 through primary. It balances regular, integrated writing practice with optional focused weekly Chinese writing classes to accelerate progress.

Two delivery tracks
- Integrated writing practice — Embedded within our regular Chinese lessons; children regularly practise short writing tasks as part of vocabulary and reading units.  
- Dedicated Chinese writing course — Weekly, focused sessions for students who need targeted instruction (Introductory → Foundation → Extension levels).

Target ages & focus
- K2–K3 / Lower primary (K2 → P2): Picture‑prompted Chinese writing, oral‑to‑written transition; emphasis on sentence formation, verbs/adjectives and basic connectors.  
- Mid primary (P3–P4): Narrative and expository Chinese writing; paragraph structure and descriptive techniques.  
- Upper primary (P5–P6): Argumentative and application Chinese writing; advanced paragraphing, cohesion and rhetorical devices.

Lesson format (typical)
- Warm‑up vocabulary & model sentences (10–15 min)  
- Picture observation & oral storytelling (10–15 min)  
- Structured writing practice with sentence frames (20–25 min)  
- Teacher feedback and guided revision (10–15 min)

Learning outcomes
- Build ability to plan and organise ideas in Chinese (who/when/where/what/why).  
- Move from short sentences to multi‑sentence paragraphs and short essays.  
- Expand Chinese vocabulary and descriptive language.  
- Learn self‑editing and respond to teacher feedback.

Progress & assessment
- Placement assessment recommended to select the right level.  
- Typical improvement window: noticeable gains in 8–12 weeks with regular practice.  
- Advanced classes align tasks with common Hong Kong primary school essay formats to support interview and admission preparation.
