# Clevercal Math (數學班 (Clevercal))

### Overview
Our Clevercal program builds strong numerical foundations and problem‑solving skills with a blend of conceptual understanding and practice. Lessons emphasise understanding before drilling — we teach ideas, then reinforce with exercises and revision.

### Suitable starting age
- Generally suitable from about **2.5 years** onwards (some younger toddlers begin with play‑based number activities).  
- Full program range: 2.5 years – 12 years (K1 – P6). Placement is determined by a short diagnostic.

### Syllabus highlights
- Early years / toddlers: number recognition, quantities, counting & number writing, basic operations introduced via games, shapes, measurement words, position words and colour vocabulary.  
- Primary years: arithmetic (including fractions, decimals, percentages), geometry, introductory algebra and problem solving, mental maths and application exercises.  
- Classes are scaffolded so local‑school and international‑school children can follow: we teach concepts clearly and provide revision exercises matching school expectations.

### Class formats & size
- Group classes: typically **4–6 students** for younger groups; **up to 6–8 students** in some older or combined groups depending on age and need.  
- Private / one‑to‑one: available on request.

### Language of instruction
- Math classes are offered in English, Cantonese or Putonghua (Mandarin) depending on teacher and group needs.

### Progress & alignment
- We combine traditional and conceptual methods — concept first, then structured practice and revision to consolidate learning. We can align examples/practice to local or international school syllabuses where needed.

### Enrollment
- Follow the standard enrolment process (short diagnostic assessment → placement → timetable & payment). See our enrollment policy for details.

### Fees & scheduling
- Refer to tuition listing or contact us for up‑to‑date fees and available time slots.
