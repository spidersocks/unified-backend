**Q: Will classes continue if Typhoon Signal No. 3 is hoisted in the afternoon?**  
A: According to Education Bureau guidelines and our own policy, all classes proceed as usual under Typhoon Signal No. 3.  
We closely monitor weather conditions, and your child’s safety is always our top priority. Please also observe the weather and take care on the way to and from class.  
If there are any changes, we will notify you immediately via official WhatsApp.
