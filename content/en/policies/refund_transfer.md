# Refund & Class Transfer Policy

Refund and transfer policy:
- We regret that we cannot, under any circumstances, give refunds or credits for lessons already paid for, even if it is a cancellation by request in advance.
- We assume that your child will continue attending classes from term to term, unless we are notified in writing.
- If students are not to continue their course, we require two weeks' notice prior to the last lesson.
- If you would like to inquire about class transfer/promotion, please contact our staff.
