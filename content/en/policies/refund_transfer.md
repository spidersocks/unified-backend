# Refund & Class Transfer Policy

Refund and transfer policy:
- We regret that we cannot, under any circumstances, give refunds or credits for lessons already paid for, even if it is a cancellation by request in advance.
- We assume that your child will continue attending classes from term to term, unless we are notified in writing.
- If students are not to continue their course, we require two weeks' notice prior to the last lesson.
- If you would like to inquire about class transfer/promotion, please contact our staff.

Frequently asked
- Q: If we are not satisfied after the first lesson, can we get a refund?  
  A: We do not offer refunds for completed lessons. However, we will review the case, gather teacher feedback, and work with you on adjustments (e.g., level/track changes) to improve fit for your child.
