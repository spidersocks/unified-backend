# Absence & Make-up Policy

Assistant Notes (do not send to parents)
- Do NOT send this policy in response to a dated leave/reschedule/cancel notification (e.g., “11/5 Julian can’t attend”). In such cases, reply only with [NO_ANSWER].
- Share this policy only when the parent explicitly asks about policy (e.g., “What’s your rescheduling policy?”). Never confirm/arrange bookings in chat.

## Quick answers
- Personal holiday/travel: Yes — treated as an absence and uses the free make‑up quota (8 sessions → 2; 10 sessions → 3). Please give ≥4 hours’ notice.
- Public holidays/centre closures (HK public holidays; Black Rain; Typhoon No. 8+): classes are suspended/arranged by us and do NOT consume your make‑up quota.
- Exceeding quota: HK$100 administrative fee per additional make‑up class.
- Make‑ups must be taken within the course period; they cannot be carried over to the next term.

## Absence and Make‑up policy
- Notice: If your child cannot attend a lesson, please notify us at least four hours before the lesson. If we are not informed, the lesson will be charged.
- Written notice: Please inform us in advance and in writing (preferably by email/WhatsApp) of classes to be cancelled so we can make the necessary arrangements.
- Make‑up window: We arrange make‑up classes within the week of the cancelled lesson(s) — by request or by enforcement, where appropriate.
- Sick leave: Please provide a doctor’s certificate so that we can arrange make‑up classes.
- No‑notice absences: Classes missed without proper notice will not be made up later and will be charged.
- Validity: Make‑up classes must be taken within the duration of the course and cannot be carried over to the next term.
- Teacher/time: We regret we cannot guarantee a replacement class with the original instructor or requested time.
- Free quota: Every student is entitled to 2 free make‑up lessons for each 8 paid sessions OR 3 free make‑up lessons for each 10 paid sessions.
- Exceeding quota: If you exceed the free make‑up class quota, an administrative fee of HK$100 will be charged for each supplementary class.
- Short absences (≤2 weeks): If your child will be away for two weeks or less and you would like to retain your time‑slot, please inform us in advance and in writing; whenever possible, we will make special arrangements.
- Longer absences (≥3 weeks): Your child’s time‑slot may be released (please contact us for further arrangements).
- Course validity: Paid courses must be completed within 3 months counting from the first lesson of a course.
