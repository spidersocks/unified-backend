# Teaching Material Policy

All teaching materials used by Little Scholars are internally developed and intended exclusively for in-class use.
These materials form part of our proprietary curriculum design and teaching framework, and are therefore not sold or distributed separately.

Our teachers regularly adapt and refine the materials according to each class’s learning level and progress to ensure the best learning outcome.
As a result, using the materials outside of class would not achieve the intended educational effectiveness.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
